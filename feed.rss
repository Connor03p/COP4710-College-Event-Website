<p>The Al-Anon Family Groups are a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength and hope in order to solve their common problems. We believe alcoholism is a family illness, and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. Al-Anon has but one purpose: To help friends and families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families and friends of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic. Whether the alcoholic is still drinking or not, Al-Anon offers hope and recovery to all people affected by the alcoholism of a loved one or friend.</p>
